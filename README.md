## Description
- The input data for this program is the Open Government Data: [electricity generation of Taiwan Power Company (TPC)](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/37331), which consists of instantaneous electricity generation data at ten-minute intervals over a three-month period.
- Most of the input data and parameters are manipulated or substituted in **main.py**
- Please check and update the following files: station_file, capacity_data, and [power_flow_data](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/37326)(The latest version of power flow data: 2021), if there are any discrepancies with the current information. (Last updated: 2023/08)
- The default target energy is solar power, wind power (onshore + offshore); change or add a new one if needed.
- The selected air pollutants emission factors are based on the emissions and net electricity generation from [Annual Report of TPC](https://www.taipower.com.tw/upload/43/43_05/111年電業年報.pdf?230829).
- The Greenhouse gas emissions and GHG emission factors are calculated by the methodology 2.2.1 and Fig. 1. in the article mentioned above.
- The system boundary of emission factor and emission intensity only include the operating phase (combustion emissions/direct emissions).
- The data only contains the TPC system's generating units.
- Please note that the temporal scope of the power generation data should be synchronized with that of the power flow data.
- As of today, there is only one TPC operating offshore wind power plant: 離岸一期 in the central region. Threfore, we use onshore wind power data to substitute for offshore wind power data for subsequent calculations, provided that the capacity factor trends are similar between the two.
